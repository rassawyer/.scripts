These are my collected Arch linux scripts, mostly stored here so I can keep
older versions, should I ever break one, and so that I do not need to recreate
them in the event of a system failure, etc.

On my system, these scripts are all located in ~/.scripts, which is added to my path at login by my ~/.bashrc. ~/.bashrc is also uploaded for reference.

The script entitled setup.sh will clone this repository and setup a system to use my custom dotfiles, etc.

Note: All of these scripts and dotfiles are configured based on my username. I will begin the process of making them relative based on $HOME, but it may take me some time to get them all modified.
