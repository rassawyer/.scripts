These are my collected Arch linux scripts, mostly stored here so I can keep
older versions, should I ever break one, and so that I do not need to recreate
them in the event of a system failure, etc.

On my system, these scripts are all located in ~/.scripts, which is added to my path at login by my ~/.bashrc. ~/.bashrc is also uploaded for reference.
